QQ","Our job is really just an assistance of the whole process.There are so many contents to organized everyday, and we know that the team members are always busy working on translation and cannot keep update with the content. Then we are going to organize for them. I think this is the only thing we can do as part of this community, because we could not really contribute to the work due to lack of ability and time. I think people in this fan-based groupchat work really well together, which I did not expected. We used to organize the content, and send links to the team leader, which was all we did in the begining. Then, we discussed about it and found the best websites to download all these videos, and we started to help downloading the videos. It was very simple though. You only need to type in the URL of the video, and it could automatically download it. However, it was so slow, because it was a foreign website with VPN on. Sometimes it takes hours, but we found it is better for people living oversea to do the downloading, which make the process much faster. If the video is simple and short, we could just translate by ourselves and give the finished video directly to the team leader for them to upload. I never consider ourselves as part of the system. We are just fans with some spare time and better internet connection, and we really appreciate the hard works of the teams. They are the one who expand this community.","I bet I am one of the most normal people in this groupchat, because I did not do many things. To me it is just a really fun thing to do. We do not have heavy workflow like others, so our daily life is just chatting random things. When we found any content really interesting, we write it down for the translation group. I did not work on dowloading the video, because I do not have VPN. Therefore, I am  glad that people in the groupchat could share the resource with me. I really love here. It is a rather small community, because the language barrier block some people. On the other hand, there are less conflicts and other terrible stuffs happened in this community. I think it is both good and bad at the same time though. If you ask me if I want this community to be larger...Honestly I hope not. I really enjoy the harmonic atmosphere here. ","I never thought this work is that important, but I found something interesting during this process. It is necessary to pick the resource that is suitable under our cultural background. Because the viewer could not choose, so we need to filter out all the harmful or 'boring' content (to Chinese viewers). I watched a lot of old TV series before, like Friends, so I got their punchline for most of the times. But  I still feel that it is not funny but confusing or even offensive sometimes. Also, there are plenty of low-quality videos of people screaming for things, which is boring as well. We have a lot of similar things on TikTok, and I think it is mor than enough for us. Our job is to get rid of these content that is not healthy to the viewers. Because think of the porpotion of population with higer education right now, it is much harder for other people to get the joke!  I have mentioned that some content could be offensive to us. For instance, I am pretty sensitive to the stereotypical image of the nation. To me,  China is a large nation consist of various culture; but to them, it is simply a different regime. I would deliberately avoid content talking about politics and economy,, because first it might not only pass the censor of the website, and second, I do not like most of them, and I think people will have the same opinion. Therefore, it is fun to pick the content that the viewers like, which is the reason I am still doing this after watching a lot of frustrating content."

QQ","In the beginning it is just me with my private account, uploading some videos. You can see the name of the account is different from our team's name today, because I am too lazy to change the name, and no one seems to have any complaint about it. At first I only uploaded the video with no people speaking or only music that I could find the lyrics, because my English is so bad.After I uploaded some videos, because it was a popular community, people found me and asked if they could help with translation. Then we formed this group. First it did not need a lot of people because we were just active in one community. However, my interest shifted after a few month, and started to upload videos from other communities. I could not work the group before, because most of them were not familiar with the new content, and I did not want to force them to watch the things they do not like.Therefore, I started to find other people to collaborate. Now I am working with four or five subjects, all of them are what I am interested in, and I have several groups to work on different subjects. I think one reason that this account received subscription so fast is that we have such diversity in our communities. Another reason is that I upload a lot of videos everyday, which is also why we are always lack of editor and translator.
Even though I am in China, I live in EST time zone. I need to get up very early to review all the content and assign them to my translators, because most of them live in UK or US. I will work on it as well as an editor, so I need to add captions to the videos. Despite of this, the problems I have is mostly on communication. First, some viewers are very annoying, they urge us to upload more videos. I will block all of the people who say it. They never understand how much work our groups have put into one video, and we are not doing this for them. Also, sometimes it is really awkward to communicate with the original creator, because it is hard to state our problems really clear. Sometimes we receive no response, and sometimes we still upload the video without the authorization. If the original creator did not want us to upload their works, we would delete the videos. I always keep all the authorization we get. They are so precious, and we really appreciate the creators could trust us to upload their works.
Personally, I also appreciate my translators and editors. They spend too much time than they should have to help me finish these work, but I have little to pay for them. Glad that the account has so many subscribers that some companies would come to me, asking if I could post their advertisement. This is one way I can give the translators and editors some money, 2 RMB (less than 0.5 dollars) for one minute, which is almost nothing. I will continue to do this until I do not have money to pay for them.

Translation,Translate the video,"Excellence in understanding colloquial English;

QQ","I started this job because I found really interesting content on YouTube, and I am good at English (I supposed) So I was considering to translate these videos a while ago. I never started doing that because first, I do not know how to download resource; second, I am afraid of copyright issues; third, I do not know how to add caption, and I am so lazy to learn it. What really made me decide to work on translation is at the beginning of this year, when I saw an account that I watched for a year was short at translators. It was winter break, and I have little things to do, so I think I can do it for fun during the winter. Therefore I added into the groupchat, and the test they gave was a five-minute long video with all the clip that are the hardest to be understanded, and I spent three hours to finish it. I got pass but they suggested that it wouldl be better to work faster. I could do much better now, about six hours for a thirty-minute video.
I meet some problems during my work. The biggest problem is time. Because I have jetlag with the management team, I always received the video at 6 to 8pm in the evening. And it takes up so much time, so my sleep schedule is really terrible this semester. As I gain more skill in the translation work, I start to set up a criteria to evaluate the videos I received. I will look at the length of the video, how many people are speaking, the accent of the speakers, the speed they speak, whether the conversation is academic or serious or colloquial. Then I can estimate how many hours I would spend on this video. Another problem is the quality of my translation. I always want the audience to truly understand everything in the video, so I will spend plenty of time just to search for a song being refered or a slang word they are using, which is also a reason why I spend longer time on translation. However, sometimes I am tired or did not pay much attention, and I found that I made a few mistakes after the video is uploaded. I will feel really sorry to the viewers (especially when someone in the comment point it out). I understand it is unavoidable and I am not a professional translator, but it still make me feel frustrated sometimes. It does not happen to me yet, but I know some people might also have the problem with the txt file or WPS, when they forget to save and the laptop crash. It is also very frustrated, so now I always frequently and unconsciously press command+s during my work.
I am glad that I can learn a lot from this process.
","I am a new translator as well. Before I joined this group, I have never done any translation before. There are some words that is easier to understand in English but hard to translate to Chinese. ""Well"" is a good example. People love to say well in the beginning of a sentence.Whenever I read that, my first impression is to translate it into Japanese instead of Chinese (I know I watched too much anime) What I want to say here is that, in Chinese, there is no such expression as ""well"". I sometimes translate it into ""good"",  depending on the context, but most of the times I just ignore it. The swear words are hard to translate as well, because I do not swear. I do not know where the swear words should insert in the sentence. I had asked one of my friend that if the ""fxxk"" in Chinese should insert in the beginning of the sentence, and she told me that this sentence should not have ""fxxk"" in it... I could never get it right. As I did more tranlation I could find the pattern (except for the swear, I will never handle it correctly) and it is really fun. I could learn a pop culture in the world better.
I really enjoy to work with people that have same interest. I am actually really bad at translation, so I asked for help a lot. Thanks for everyone who can bear me and give me really useful suggestion. People has different background ranging from design to computer engineering to material science, coming together just because we love the same thing..It is also surprising that most of us are currently college student study abroad in United States, so we are planning a North America meetup after quarantine. I am glad that this can becomes a platform of making new friends",
Adding caption,Add caption to the video,"Understand colloquial English;
Skilled in the editing softwares;","Arctime / AE / Premiere
QQ","I like to share the contents that I love to others, but I am not really good at English. Only pass the college-level English test, and it is not sufficient to do translation. When the dialogue become more complicated, a lot of people speaking at the same time, or have slangs in it, I still need helps from the translation people. People always think adding caption is easy, because they think that you pull the video and the document into an editing software, and it just automatically generate the video that you need. I hope the work could be this simple as well, but it is not. Adjusting timeline is the most tedious job ever. You have to listen to one sentence over and over again, then making slight adjustment. However, I still love to do these because these videos just can make me happy for a whole day. If I can give any suggestion, never use Premiere or After Effect to add caption, it is so inefficient since the only thing it does is to slow down your computer. Arctime is the best.
I really enjoy this community. A lot of great people from different background just want to share these contents to more viewers. I just want our team to have more editor so that I can have less work. We are really short of editor right now. I also think being a part of this is really important, because you can see how hard it takes to make one of these videos out, so I am doing as best as I can to support the individuals that are doing the same thing, sometimes just leave a like or a comment will make their day.
By the way, I also did some simple translation with the short videos, because I love the feeling of finish a series of task myself. I upload these to my own account to find more friends with the same interests, also receive more subscription! ","We are really lack of editing people.We have about twenty translators now, but only five editor. So we have to do more works.  People never thought that this is a time-consuming job, but it is. First, an editor should also understand English as well, though the requirement is lower. If not, you would not know where each sentence goes. Also, we spent a lot of time on minor adjustment of timeline for a better watching experience for viewers. In the begining, we use differet color for each characters. However, as new characters coming out and new viewers flooding into this community, we found the limitation of the colors: it is not enough and hard to distinguish. Then we change it into the initial of the characters, which is easier to  differentiate. We worked on the typeface as well. At first, we use pure color, and we found that it mix with the background which is hardly legible. After we use the new naming system, we changed the font color to all white, but same problems sometimes happened with light background. Therefore, we added a black stripe outside the letter that looks much better than before. I think it might be already a common snese for real video editors, but we were beginners at that time. We still do minor changes on typefaces and position sometimes, and each editor might have different habi. Overall, we are quite satisfied with the result we have now.
Recently, we started to really edit the video, and making footage by ourselves. We tried to make some funny videos compilation that did not required much translation works. We were also planing to do some similar videos and stream working process (?) It will be quite fun to chat with our viewers and receive suggestion. And we hope is we do these, they would encourage more people to join us, because we really need more editor right now.",
