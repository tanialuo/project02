"Hello, nice to meet you. Glad to see you here. Before you can access this project, I think it is necessary to provide you with some background knowledge. Do you know the Great Fire Wall in China? Do you know the purpose of it and how it functions?","The Great Firewall of China is the combination of legislative actions and technologies enforced by the People’s Republic of China to regulate the Internet domestically. Its role in internet censorship in China is to block access to selected foreign websites and to slow down cross-border internet traffic. The effect includes: limiting access to foreign information sources, blocking foreign internet tools (e.g. Google search, Facebook, Twitter, Wikipedia, and others) and mobile apps, and requiring foreign companies to adapt to domestic regulations.","Now you know more about the Great Firewall. Let's talk about us. We transport some videos from YouTube and Vimeo to the video platform in China. In this project, I interview my friends about their experience and reflection on this job. Please note, this project is not intended to either critique or settle a political debate. I hope that you can have your own opinion over the Great Fire Wall from this project and the work we are doing.",
